/// Anatomy of a Java Program

// Function - block of code that performs a task

/*

ReturnType Name() {
    ...
}

*/

void sendEmail() {
    
}

// Every program should have main function - entrypoint into our program

void main() {

}

/* 
Functions should belong to a class (Main) - container for 1 or more related func.

Methods (main()) - functions that are part of a class

Every class and methods should have:
access modifier (public) - special keyword that determines if other 
classes and methods in a program can access these classes and methods

To name classes, use PascalNamingConvention.

To name methods, camelNamingConvention. 

To package classes, we use packages.
